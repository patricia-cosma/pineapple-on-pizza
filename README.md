# Portofolio

Hi there, 

And welcome on my GitHub. :) Don't go away if you don't like pineapple on pizza - the name is here just for inspiration.
This project represents my website portofolio. Here, I try to put together some of my study projects (which you can find on my profile), some blog posts and finally my resume. The goal is to constantly maintain and grow this project as I go to further represent what I learn.

## General Info

I find it more useful and easier to learn by doing and trying to figure out step by step what every function does, especially because I use the Live Server on Visual Studio Code and I can visually and instantly see what works, what does not, if I modify something what the impact would be and so on.
This code is just an attempt at learning and grasping more of what is out there.
