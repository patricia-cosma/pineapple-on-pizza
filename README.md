Learning through practice with a one-page website using HTML & CSS

This is my first attempt at creating something with HTML & CSS (I don't quite remember what happened during high school so let's just say that :D )

Learning with direct examples and trying to figure out what the code does, it helps me more in my learning process, especially because I use the Live Server on Visual Studio Code and I can visually and instantly see what works, what does not, if I modify something what the impact would be and so on.

This code will be the base on which I would like to develop my first website to go live once I have more projects and experience.

Thank you for stopping by,
Patricia
