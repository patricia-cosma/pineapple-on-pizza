Learning through practice with a one-page website using HTML & CSS

Hi there, 

And welcome on my GitHub. :) Don't go away if you don't like pineapple on pizza - the name is here just for inspiration.
Let's have a look at this project (from top to bottom) and the 'story' behind it.

This is my first attempt at creating something with HTML & CSS (I don't quite remember what happened during high school so let's just say that)
I find it more useful and easier to learn by doing and trying to figure out step by step what every function does, especially because I use the Live Server on Visual Studio Code and I can visually and instantly see what works, what does not, if I modify something what the impact would be and so on.
This code is just an attempt at learning and grasping more of what is out there.
