# pineapple-on-pizza
Learning through practice with a one-page website using HTML & CSS

Hi there, 

And welcome on my GitHub. :) Don't go away if you don't like pineapple on pizza - the name is here just for inspiration.
Let's have a look at this project (from top to bottom) and the 'story' behind it.

This is my first attempt at creating something with HTML & CSS (I don't quite remember what happened during high school so let's just say that)
I find it more useful and easier to learn by doing and trying to figure out step by step what every function does, especially because I use the Live Server on Visual Studio Code and I can visually and instantly see what works, what does not, if I modify something what the impact would be and so on.
This code is just an attempt at learning and grasping more of what is out there.

I created an icon on Favicon and this was my final choice:
![page-icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107708977/179019615-b2e14b57-7400-41a9-ae18-957bf827dbd4.png)

The hero section is pretty simple and easy to navigate. Hovering over the navigation bar items or the button, you'll get a different colour. Additionally, clicking on any of the before-mentioned items will redirect you to that specific location on the page.

The Services section would serve as a place in the page to display one's strenghts. In this version, you can see all the items next to each other. However, as it is responsive, they will also come in 2x2 format or one below the other.

Next in line is the Projects section. This would eventually be the place to add briefly some ideas about my last projects. Hovering over the projects will have a small transition effect on the page, emphasizing so the project at hand.

The fourth part is dedicated to the About section. It is meant to be short, precise and the button, just like the one in the hero section will change its colour when you hover. (there is no resume added at the moment)

Lastly, a Contact section was added. Hovering over each item will diminish the border around it.

I filled the footer with a signature and links to some social media channels - let's connect.

If you'll display the page on a smaller screen, all the items in the navigation bar will be replaced by a hamburger menu.
