# Portfolio

Hi there, 

And welcome on my GitHub. :) <br>
Don't go away if you don't like pineapple on pizza - the name is here just for inspiration.

## Scope
This project represents my website portfolio. Here, I tried to put together some of my study projects (you can find all of them on my <a href="https://github.com/patricia-cosma?tab=repositories" target="_blank">profile</a>), my external blog and finally my resume. The goal is to constantly maintain and grow this project as I learn new technologies, come across interesting ideas and develop my skills in order to be able to use it more and more in my professional life. Once I get real-life projects, the "Study Projects" section will simply become "Projects" where I can showcast my work.

## General Info

I find it more useful and easier to learn by practice and figure along the way the needed improvements and how everything intertwines. I take out pieces of code to see what happens, I replicate in my own style new designs I come across or I just add another study project. Theory is important, but without putting it into the bigger picture, it's harder to remember it later. That's why I also deciding to start a <a href="https://dev.to/patriciacosma" target="_blank"> blog</a> so that I can put together the theory and the practice in a more structured manner.
<br><br>
Creating this project also helped me understand better, bit by bit, how each functionality works with one another (e.g.: `display: flex` with `align-items` and `justify-content`). I got to explore how to create a hamburger menu for smaller devices, but also worked on the responsiveness of my website using `@media` queries and specific CSS units of measurement.

## Technologies and Languages
This project is created using:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Git
* GitHub
* Visual Studio Code

## Website
You can find the current published version at <a href="https://patriciacosma.ro/" target="_blank">patriciacosma.ro</a>.

## Limitations
Because it was exposed to a lot of changes since it was first created, the source code is not yet fully arranged as it was not a priority in the current version. The next version will be more revised and accurate in terms of code, looks and responsiveness.
